Sound Synthesis is an interactive light and music display that allows anyone passing by to become the party DJ. There are 3 touch points to this system. The first is the ‘DJ console’ which is made up of childrens blocks. Each block controls a different sound stem which is triggered by placing a block on the console. The next two touch points are wireless clear spheres which contain LEDs and a gyroscope that triggers another sound stem when the sphere is moved. These interactions not only activate sound and lighting but it also invokes a sense of play among all ages
